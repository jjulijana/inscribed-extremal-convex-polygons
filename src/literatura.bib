    abstract = {A convex polygon Q is inscribed in a convex polygon P if every side of P contains at least one vertex of Q. We present algorithms for finding a minimum area and a minimum perimeter convex polygon inscribed in any given convex n-gon in O(n) and O(n3) time, respectively. We also investigate other variants of this problem.}

    abstract = {A convex polygon Q is circumscribed about a convex polygon P if every vertex of P lies on at least one side of Q. We present an algorithm for finding a maximum area convex polygon circumscribed about any given convex n-gon in O(n3) time. As an application, we disprove a conjecture of Farris. Moreover, for the special case of regular n-gons we find an explicit solution.}
